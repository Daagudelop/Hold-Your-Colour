# Common

The `Common` directory contains general-purpose resources and scripts designed to be shared across multiple parts of the game. Unlike `addons`, which store external plugins, `Common` focuses on reusable logic and tools developed specifically for this project.

---

## Purpose

- Provide reusable logic and assets that are independent of specific game mechanics or entities.
- Encourage modular development by centralizing shared functionalities.

---

## Contents

Currently, this directory does not contain any files. As the project grows, `Common` will house:
- Scripts for generic utilities or tools.
- Reusable animations, shaders, or visual effects.
- Logic that could be shared across multiple projects.

---

## Guidelines for Contributions

1. **General-Purpose Only**: Add only resources or scripts that can be reused in different contexts.
2. **Consistency**: Follow the naming conventions outlined in the main `README.md`:
   - Use `PascalCase` for directories.
   - Use `snake_case` for filenames.
3. **Documentation**: Provide a brief explanation of the purpose of any new addition directly in the script or this `README.md`.

## Examples of Future Additions

- A script to manage screen resolutions or scaling.
- A generic shader for visual effects like blurring or color grading.
- Animations that can be applied across multiple UI components or entities.

---

This directory will grow as the project evolves, becoming a key resource for maintaining modularity and scalability.
